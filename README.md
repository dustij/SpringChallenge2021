# Spring Challenge 2021

## Overview

This repository contains my personal project for developing an AI algorithm designed to play the Spring Challenge 2021 on [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com/). The challenge involves strategic gameplay, where AI competes in a simulated environment, making decisions based on game state and rules.

## Project Description

The main goal of this project is to create a functional and efficient AI that can autonomously play and compete in the Spring Challenge 2021. The AI uses TypeScript, with a focus on functional programming principles to handle game state and decision-making processes.

### Key Features

- **Functional TypeScript Implementation**: The AI is implemented in TypeScript, utilizing functional programming concepts to ensure code clarity and efficiency.
- **Pure Function Focus**: Efforts have been made to use pure functions wherever possible, to minimize side effects and make the code more predictable and testable.
- **Game State Management**: The AI manages the game state without mutable global variables, using function arguments and closures.

## Strategy

The AI's strategy for the game is built around analyzing the current game state and making the most optimal decisions based on the available actions. This includes evaluating the best moves, managing resources, and adapting to the opponent's strategy.

## Development and Testing

The algorithm was developed iteratively, with continuous testing against various scenarios in the CodinGame environment. This iterative approach helped in fine-tuning the strategy and improving the AI's performance.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Decision Algorithms**: Enhance the AI's decision-making process by integrating more advanced algorithms or machine learning techniques.
- **Performance Optimization**: Continual code optimization for better performance in the game environment.
- **Adaptive Learning**: Implementing features for the AI to learn and adapt from past games.
